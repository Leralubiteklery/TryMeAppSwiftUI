# TryMeAppSwiftUI

This is a game app with the idea to move slider thumb as close as possible to target value. 
App is writtent in SwiftUI and hosts UIKit element - slider. UIKit slider has been chosen due to its ability to change opacity depending on how close current slider value is to the target value.
App contains 1 screen with a slider and 2 buttons. "Try me!" button checks current value against target value and shows score in alert. "Start over" button changes target value and current values in order to start a new game.
